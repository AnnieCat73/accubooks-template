### Images
All images used in the preview are from pexels.com. You can use them if you wish in your project or change them to add your own.

### Credits
- Images by Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/
- For the social icons I used Bootstrap Icons. They are linked in the head tag. They can be found at https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
- Form validation for the contact page can be activated  by creating an access key at https://web3forms.com/ This should be a working contact form. To receive email, replace YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE with your actual Access Key. Create Access Key here ðŸ‘‰ https://web3forms.com/

### CSS Structure
The CSS structure is mobile first meaning everything up to Media Queries is for small screens and upwards. Media queries start with 48em screen width and upwards and continue with 87.5em screen width and upwards.

Please note that for each section I have added the media queries right below so there is no need to scroll down to the end of the css file to locate them. Just go to the end of each section and you will find the corresponding media queries.

### Favicon
All the files and images found in the root folder are related to the favicon only. I got it from favicon.io. If you wish to change it you can go there an make your own and replace my favicon files with yours. Favicon.io favicon files are required to be placed in the root folder.
